vimrc
===
This is my vim configuration for both Linux and OS X. It's built around C++ and
Clojure development, primarily.

## Installation
After cloning into, say, `~/projects/vimrc`, you can install with just two
links.

```bash
# Remove ~/.vim and ~/.vimrc if they exist
$ ln -s ~/projects/vimrc ~/.vim
$ ln -s ~/projects/vimrc/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
